This is the source code of a series focused on giving some basic ideas about how to use [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Dagger2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) & [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) together with a [Clean Architecture](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

##### [Part 1 - Dagger 2](http://saulmm.github.io/when-Thor-and-Hulk-meet-dagger2-rxjava-1/)
